This poster presentation discusses our research on the enhancer demethylator phenotype in clear-cell renal cell carcinomas. We explore how this phenotype relates to immune dysfunction and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors, providing new insights into potential treatment strategies for this type of cancer.
