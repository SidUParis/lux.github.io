In this oral presentation, I introduce MOVICS, an R package we developed for multi-omics data integration and visualization in cancer subtyping. The talk focuses on its application in urothelial carcinoma research, demonstrating how this tool can enhance our understanding of cancer genomics and potentially improve patient stratification for personalized treatment approaches.
