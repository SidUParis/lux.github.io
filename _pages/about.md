Hi, I'm Xiaofan, a Bioinformatics Scientist and Biostatistician specializing in cancer genomics and precision oncology.

Currently, I'm working as a Postdoctoral Fellow at [IGBMC](https://www.igbmc.fr/igbmc) (L'Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire) in Strasbourg, France. Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](https://github.com/SidUParis/lux.github.io/assets/Curriculum_vitae.docx).

## Research Interests

My research focuses on:
- Multi-omics integration in cancer research
- Advanced molecular classification methods
- Predicting immunotherapy response in clear cell renal cell carcinoma
- Development of bioinformatics tools for cancer research

## Current Work

At IGBMC, I'm part of the Molecular and Translational Oncology team under the supervision of Pr. Gabriel Malouf. Our work involves cutting-edge research in cancer genomics, with a particular focus on urothelial and renal carcinomas.

## Achievements

- Developed MOVICS, an R package for multi-omics integration and visualization in cancer subtyping
- Published in high-impact journals including Nature Communications, Clinical Cancer Research, and Genome Biology
- Contributed to three Chinese patents for molecular classification of genitourinary system tumors
