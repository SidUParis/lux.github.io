Hi, I’m Xiaofan, a data scientist of bioinformatics and biostatistics, specializing in cancer genomics and precision oncology.

Currently, I'm working as a Postdoctoral Fellow at [IGBMC](https://www.igbmc.fr/igbmc) (L'Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire) in Strasbourg, France. Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](https://1drv.ms/w/c/56e714b25d295911/EeSie0gorGlPhdZv2oRzsMsBGMWaIhhpdQJ7ksecyVFTGg?e=tAECzm).

## Research Interests

- Multi-omics integration in cancer heterogeneity research
- Biomarker identification in predicting immunotherapy response in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma with real-world clinical trial data
- In-silico identification of new therapeutic targets for renal cell carcinoma

## Current Work

At IGBMC, I am a member of the [Molecular and Translational Oncology](https://www.igbmc.fr/en/recherche/teams/molecular-and-translational-oncology) team, led by Professor [Gabriel Malouf](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=OTn9RJ4AAAAJ&hl=en), a distinguished physician-scientist specializing in kidney cancer. Our work involved cutting-edge research in cancer genomics, with particular focus on urothelial and renal carcinomas and rare cancers. We aim to deepen our understanding of tumor heterogeneity and pathogenesis, with the ultimate goal of pioneering advancements in cancer treatment.
